# test_hello_world_arduino_uno_r4_pio
This respository for testing Arduino Uno R4 with PlatformIO.

## 1. hello_world
This is a simple "Hello, World!" program for Arduino Uno R4 using PlatformIO. It blinks the built-in LED on and off every second.

## 2. hello_adc
This program reads the analog value from an analog pin and prints the value to the Serial Monitor.

## 3. hello_json_led
This program demonstrates how to parse JSON data to control an LED on the Arduino Uno R4. It uses the ArduinoJson library to read JSON commands and turn the LED on or off based on the received data.
